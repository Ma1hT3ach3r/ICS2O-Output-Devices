        <h1>Output Devices (H9)</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Describe the basic functionality of your piece of hardware.
What makes a good (insert name of hardware piece here) ? What should you look for when buying one? What if you are on a budget?</p>
<div id="WAOD">
    <h3>What are Output Devices? And how are they different from Input Devices?</h3>
</div>
    <div id="P1">
        <p>An output devices is any device that recives data from another machine such as a computer or phone. Some commonly known output devices are headphones, monitors, printers, and speakers.  On the other hand, input devices are the oposite of output devices; they are devices that send data unlike output devices that recive data. An example of an input device is a motherboard. Some devices can also have components of both input and output devices like a computer or a phone. The computer's moniter screen is an output device while the motherboard in it is an input device.</p>

<div id="WAOD1">
    <h3>Why are Output Devices so important?</h3>
</div>
<div id="P2">
    <p>Output devices are very important because without them, people would not be able to access the information from an input device. For example, a phone is no good without the screen because then you can not see what is happening on your phone.</p>
</div>
<div id="WAOD2">
    <h3>How do you know that your Output Device will work?</h3>
</div>
<div id="P3">
<ul>The main factors that show if an output device will work are:<br>
    <br><li><b>How old the device is:</b> The device's age is a big factor on how well it will work. If the output device is new, it means that the device has been recently tested to ensure it will work the best. Over time however, the device will most likely lose its edge. Like people in a way, devices eventually will not work anymore because the device's parts are getting old, therefore problems will start to occur to the device. </li>
    <br><li><b>Is the device damaged:</b> The device's condition will highly affect how well the device will work. For example if you dropped your phone from a very high distance, your phone will most likely be damaged internally, and externally because of the damage caused by the fall. Not only does the damage on the device have an effect on how well your device will work, but also some other components can affect your device's condition. For example, if the wire conecting your headphones to your phone is damaged, then the info will not be transfered from the phone to the headphone efficiently.</li>
    <br><li><b>Is the internet connection good or bad:</b> The internet connection's quality will affect how fast the data is transmitted. A fast internet connection will transfer data quickely while a slow connection will transfer data slowly from an input device to an output device.</li>
</ul>
